# Employee Layoffs :dragon:
Hobby project done by me for my development plan in Blueground.

The project is currently in the process of getting dockerized and the server-side is dockerized already. In order to run the application:

In server side, just do the following commands to run the application on docker.

```
./gradlew build
```
```
docker-compose up --build
```

In client side, just write the following command and visit ```localhost:3000``` to see the application.

```
npm start
```
